I am a Computer Science student at UCI set to graduate in 2023.

I am an active member of UCI's VGDC and have a few videogame repositories here. Looking for possible future in videogame development. Most of my work so far is in C#/Unity, but I am also looking into possible experiences with Unreal Engine.
